Project Documentation
Overview
This documentation provides instructions for setting up, running, and managing the project using Docker. It includes steps for making database migrations, running Docker commands, and handling user permissions.

Prerequisites
Docker
Docker Compose
Ensure you have these installed and running on your system.

Setting Up the Project
Clone the Repository

Clone the project repository to your local machine:


git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_directory>
Start Docker Service

Make sure Docker is running:


sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl status docker
Add User to Docker Group

To avoid permission issues, add your user to the Docker group:


sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
After running this command, log out and log back in, or use:


newgrp docker
Running the Project
Build and Start Containers

Build and start the Docker containers using Docker Compose:


docker-compose up --build
Accessing the Application

Once the containers are running, access the application through the web browser at http://localhost:<port>, where <port> is the port defined in your docker-compose.yml file.

Database Migrations
Run Migrations

To apply database migrations, first access the Django container:


docker-compose exec web bash
Then, inside the container, run:


python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
After running migrations, you can exit the container:


exit
Create Superuser

To create a superuser for Django admin, run:


docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
Follow the prompts to enter the superuser details.

Managing Docker Containers
List Running Containers

To list running containers:


docker ps
Stop and Remove Containers

To stop and remove all containers, networks, and volumes:


docker-compose down
To stop a specific container:


docker stop <container_id_or_name>
To remove a specific container:


docker rm <container_id_or_name>
View Logs

To view logs from the Docker containers:


docker-compose logs
Troubleshooting
Permission Error: Ensure Docker is running and your user has been added to the Docker group. Use sudo if needed, or log out and log back in.

Container Name Conflict: If a container name conflict occurs, remove the existing container:


docker rm -f <container_id_or_name>
Connection Errors: Verify that Docker and Docker Compose are correctly installed and configured.
