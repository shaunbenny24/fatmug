roject Documentation
Overview
This documentation provides instructions for setting up, running, and managing the project using Docker. It includes steps for making database migrations, running Docker commands, and handling user permissions.

Prerequisites
Docker
Docker Compose
Ensure you have these installed and running on your system.

Setting Up the Project
Clone the Repository

Clone the project repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_directory>
Start Docker Service

Make sure Docker is running:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl status docker
Add User to Docker Group

To avoid permission issues, add your user to the Docker group:

bash
Copy code
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
After running this command, log out and log back in, or use:

bash
Copy code
newgrp docker
Running the Project
Build and Start Containers

Build and start the Docker containers using Docker Compose:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up --build
Accessing the Application

Once the containers are running, access the application through the web browser at http://localhost:<port>, where <port> is the port defined in your docker-compose.yml file.

Database Migrations
Run Migrations

To apply database migrations, first access the Django container:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose exec web bash
Then, inside the container, run:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
After running migrations, you can exit the container:

bash
Copy code
exit
Create Superuser

To create a superuser for Django admin, run:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
Follow the prompts to enter the superuser details.

Managing Docker Containers
List Running Containers

To list running containers:

bash
Copy code
docker ps
Stop and Remove Containers

To stop and remove all containers, networks, and volumes:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose down
To stop a specific container:

bash
Copy code
docker stop <container_id_or_name>
To remove a specific container:

bash
Copy code
docker rm <container_id_or_name>
View Logs

To view logs from the Docker containers:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose logs
Troubleshooting
Permission Error: Ensure Docker is running and your user has been added to the Docker group. Use sudo if needed, or log out and log back in.

Container Name Conflict: If a container name conflict occurs, remove the existing container:

bash
Copy code
docker rm -f <container_id_or_name>
Connection Errors: Verify that Docker and Docker Compose are correctly installed and configured.

License
